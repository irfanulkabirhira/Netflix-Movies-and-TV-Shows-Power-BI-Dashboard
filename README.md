# Netflix-Movies-and-TV-Shows-Power-BI-Dashboard
This Power BI project presents a comprehensive visual analysis of the Netflix content library over time, covering thousands of titles across movies and TV shows. The goal of this dashboard is to help users quickly understand the distribution of Netflix content by genre, rating, release year, country of origin, and type (Movie vs TV Show).

At the top, key performance indicators (KPIs) give an instant snapshot of the dataset:

  Total Titles: 5,334

  Total Ratings: 18

  Total Genres: 335

  Date Range: From 1942 to 2021

   Locations: 604 unique countries or regions

The dashboard features interactive visuals including:

   Bar charts showing the most common ratings (e.g., TV-MA, TV-14) and genres (e.g., Dramas, Stand-Up Comedy).

   A donut chart comparing the count of Movies vs TV Shows.

   A tree map showing the distribution of titles by country, highlighting top contributors like the United States and India.

   A line chart visualizing the trend of content production by year, reflecting Netflix's expansion in the 2010s.

This dashboard was built to strengthen Power BI skills, including data modeling, DAX calculations, and design for storytelling. It uses clean, dark-themed visuals for clarity and emphasis. The project demonstrates how business intelligence tools can turn raw data into powerful, insight-driven narratives.
